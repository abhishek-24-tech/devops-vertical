# VISION

## Why This Vision Exists
We are building the DevOps capability at ColoredCow from the ground up.  
This is not a support function — it is a horizontal engineering capability and a future service vertical.

This vision describes:
- what we’re building  
- how we work  
- why early contributors matter so much  
- and the long-term outcomes we expect from this vertical  

It is written openly because we want candidates, collaborators, and teams to evaluate how we think.

# 1. What We’re Building

## A Foundational DevOps & Reliability Capability
Our goal is to build a DevOps practice that combines:
- engineering craftsmanship  
- operational reliability  
- clarity and simplicity  
- cost-efficient cloud design  
- long-term maintainability  

This capability should accelerate every engineering team at ColoredCow — and eventually become a service we deliver to clients.

## A Vertical That Stands On Its Own
DevOps becomes:
- a core engineering strength  
- a trusted internal partner  
- a repeatable, productized offering  
- a source of visible business outcomes  

We want this practice to mature into something that influences both internal engineering and external client delivery.

# 2. Entrepreneurship Inside Engineering

Early DevOps engineers here are not joining an established team —  
they are **founding contributors shaping a capability from zero**.

This requires:
- taking ownership without waiting for instructions  
- designing systems that last years, not weeks  
- filling gaps in process, documentation, and tooling  
- contributing to sales, case studies, and learning content  
- working in an environment where everything is still evolving  

This is a role for people who want to build, not inherit.

# 3. What Success Looks Like (3–5 Years)

### A recognized DevOps practice delivering measurable outcomes:
- reduced downtime + better reliability  
- faster releases & higher deployment frequency  
- lower cloud/infra cost through better design  
- stronger security & predictable operational posture  

### Visible proof of our capability:
- **20+ public case studies** showing real-world ROI  
- open templates, guides, patterns, and examples  
- repeatable internal and client-facing playbooks  

### A strong, scalable team structure:
- a **senior-light model** powered by trained juniors  
- rapid ramp-up through documentation, standards, and mentorship  
- a pipeline of DevOps talent grown internally  

### A repeatable business motion:
- using audits, case studies, and reliability reports  
- converting them into retainers and DevOps-led engagements  

This practice will be both an engineering asset **and** a business driver.

# 4. Who We Serve

### 1. Small and mid-sized digital agencies  
Who need predictable hosting, stable deployments, and reliable delivery pipelines.

### 2. Mission-driven organisations & NGOs  
Who need secure, cost-effective, and resilient platforms to run their programs.

### 3. Early-stage SaaS & product teams  
Who want strong foundations before scaling or going to market.

These groups value craft, clarity, cost-efficiency, and reliability — all strengths we aim to build.

# 5. Our North-Star Engineering Principles

### **Ownership over activity**  
We care about outcomes, not task completion.

### **Simplicity over cleverness**  
Systems should be easy to maintain, understand, and onboard.

### **Measure what matters**  
We focus on uptime, deployment frequency, change lead time, MTTR, and cost.

### **Security by default**  
Security is part of delivery — not a checklist item.

### **Teach & share**  
We build documentation, case studies, and tools so the team grows faster than individuals.

These principles apply to everything we build, automate, and operate.

# 6. Transparency as a Strategy

We keep this repository public because:
- craft attracts craft  
- transparency attracts better candidates  
- engineering cultures should be visible  
- sharing our thinking builds trust  

We don’t pretend to have every process perfected.  
We grow in public, refine in public, and improve in public.

---
## 7. Growing T-shaped Engineers
Each DevOps engineer should:
- Go deep in cloud, automation, systems, and reliability  
- Go broad across backend, security, QA, networking, and SRE principles  

We’re shaping engineers who can design, build, operate, and scale software systems end-to-end.

This creates both:
- faster delivery for teams  
- better career growth for engineers

# 8. Vision Statement

**To build a world-class DevOps capability that elevates every engineering team at ColoredCow, delivers meaningful business outcomes for our clients, and grows through clarity, entrepreneurship, and uncompromising craft.**
