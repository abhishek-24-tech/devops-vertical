# DevOps Contribution & Quality Guidelines

These guidelines define **how we work**, **what “good” looks like**, and the mindset we expect from early DevOps team members and candidates.

This is not a rules document — it’s a **quality bar** and a **thinking framework** for anyone contributing to this repository.

# 🚀 Why These Guidelines Exist

ColoredCow is building a DevOps vertical from the ground up.  
This means our early contributors — including candidates — play a key role not only in the technical work, but in shaping:

- documentation quality  
- public assets  
- service readiness  
- clarity of thinking  
- and even parts of our marketing & sales motion  

This requires **systems thinking, initiative, and an entrepreneurial mindset**.

These guidelines help ensure everything we publish reflects that spirit.

# 🧠 Core Mindset Principles

### **1. Ownership over tasks**
We value people who take responsibility for outcomes, not instructions.  
If something is unclear, incomplete, or missing — you take initiative.

### **2. Think like a DevEx engineer**
Good DevOps is invisible.  
Your work should make life easier for developers, clients, and future maintainers.

### **3. Clarity over cleverness**
Public documentation must be simple enough for anyone to understand.

### **4. Measure, don’t guess**
Where possible, quantify:
- downtime reduced  
- cost savings  
- lead-time improvements  
- reliability improvements  

Even estimates show structured thinking.

### **5. Build for reuse**
Templates, scripts, checklists, patterns — anything that repeats should be reusable.

### **6. Bias for automation**
If something will be repeated more than twice, automate it or write a guide.

### **7. Entrepreneurial contribution**
Early contributors also shape:
- case studies  
- marketing clarity  
- messaging  
- processes  
- public examples  

We don’t have separate “marketing” or “sales” teams right now — your work builds the vertical.

# 📘 Documentation Standards

### **1. Keep everything Markdown**
We use `.md` for readability and accessibility.

### **2. Write with context**
Always answer:
- What  
- Why  
- How  
- Expected impact  

### **3. Use structured sections**
Recommended structure:
- Overview
- Problem / Context
- Approach
- Tools & Techniques
- Expected Outcomes
- Questions / Risks

### **4. Add diagrams when needed**
Even simple ASCII diagrams are welcome.

### **5. Make your writing “public ready”**
Top-level files like:
- README.md  
- VISION.md  
- ROADMAP.md  
- Assignment.md  

should be fully readable and polished.

# 📦 Case Study Guidelines (Public-Ready)

Every public case study should:

- Tell a clear BEFORE → AFTER story  
- Highlight business outcomes  
- Quantify improvements where possible  
- Mention constraints (budget, infra, timelines)  
- Explain your reasoning, not just tools  
- Be written in narrative clarity (non-technical readers should also understand)

Format:
1. Client Overview
2. Problem Summary
3. What Was At Stake
4. Our Approach
5. Execution
6. Outcomes (with numbers)
7. What We Learned  

Tone:  
Clear, humble, practical, entrepreneurial.

# 🧪 Assignment Guidelines (For Candidates)

When submitting your assignment:

- Demonstrate thinking, not tool commands  
- Keep answers crisp  
- Add assumptions where needed  
- Show how you think about reliability, CI/CD, DevEx  
- Share trade-offs (“I chose X over Y because…”)  
- Add diagrams if it helps  
- If unclear — ask a question in your PR  

We’re looking for:
- clarity  
- structure  
- curiosity  
- initiative  
- communication discipline  

Not perfection.

### **General Contributions**
- Open issues for any proposal  
- Keep changes small and reviewable

Everything you contribute — even as a candidate — shapes how this capability grows.

You’re not just applying for a job.  
You’re helping build something meaningful from the ground up.

Let’s build it together.
